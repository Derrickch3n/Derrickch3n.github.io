            <p class="container newroman">Derrick is in the graduating class of 24' at Nest+M. He decided to take a Computer Science Class in his senior year
                to broaden is knowledge about the field. Originally, he wanted to take this class because his friend recommended him to
                because his friends thinks that it would help him become a better problem solver and break down general concepts algorithimically
                Derrick would never have thought that these skills he honed through Computer Science would help him in other classes, like AP Statistics and AP Chemistry,
                and his own projects. Derrick grew up in New York City, Queens where he often would go Queen Center Mall to shop with his aunt and his relatives.
                Derrick wrote about this part of his New York because it was an integral part of his childhood, his coming of age and his obsession with skincare through the Mall's
                Sephora.
