                <h2 id="centerq">The Center of Queens</h2>
                <p class="indent newroman">In the middle of Queens sits the Queens Center Mall, or at least that’s why I thought it was called Queens Center Mall
                    because it should be in the center of Queens, right? This is a question I asked all my friends or something I would ask
                    anyone that lives in Queens. If you're from Queens you should know the Queens Center Mall or you live under a rock. It’s the
                    biggest mall in Queens and when I tell you big it’s big.</p>
                <p class="indent newroman">When I’m at the food court in the Queens Center Mall millions of bags with the logos of McDonald's, Chick-Fil-a, Popeyes, and Panda Express flood my eyes.
                    My wallet sighs in relief knowing that these are all places that are inexpensive. The escalator takes me and my friend down from the second floor and immediately
                    we know what to get: Chick-fil-a. My eyes then catch something else of even more significance: a seat. It calls my name and yearns for my presence, I rush towards
                    it before anyone can claim it from me. I smile knowing that I’ve secured a seat for both of us and we don’t have to worry about our seats anymore. It’s not like
                    that in Manhattan, when I went to the Hudson Yards mall to eat at Fuku with my mom and my brother, I look at the menu and wince. I turn to my mom and shake my head
                    disapprovingly. My mom urges me to get something because I’m hungry and I submit to my hunger. We couldn’t even get a seat for my mom to sit in because of the
                    uncanny seating arrangements.</p>
                <p class="indent newroman">The Queens Center Mall redefines shopping for people from Queens, we’re not like people in Manhattan
                    in order to shop for our clothes we would travel to go to Bloomingdale’s or Aritizia so we could feel exclusive.
                    The mall instead includes, it tells you that it’s okay to shop from Hollister because we’re here for the mall.
                    It brings us people from different backgrounds and for us to shop in one building. If you’re here for Sephora,
                    you’re in the mall, if you’re here for Timberlands you’re here under the mall. The Queen Center Mall tells you
                    that you’re not alone in shopping for these things.</p>
                <p class="indent newroman">JCPenny, Disney, The Lego Store, Macy, and the food court are the shops that my aunt would take me and my
                    siblings to at the mall. We would sit there walking until our feet hurt until we begged for her to finish up. My aunt would be
                    shopping for clothes for us or for her children. I didn’t share the proclivity for shopping, on the contrary, I despised it for how
                    long she took. My favorite part of that ritual was to go to the food court and enjoy McDonald's and run around in the playground.
                    JCPenny, Disney, The Lego Store, Macy changed to Macy, Bath and Bodyworks, The Body Shop, Elf, and Sephora as I transitioned into
                    my middle school years. This route I took would be the place that I went with my friends as I began to shop for myself. I loved
                    skincare and I was obsessed with finding a cure for acne in those places. I would walk in Sephora for hours looking at the skincare
                    options and turning them over to read their ingredients. As my route in the mall changed, a part of my identity changed as well.</p>
                <p class="indent newroman">It’s almost like the Queen Center Mall is a character-creation game. When you come in, you see their options
                    of stores, and you pick which one you want to explore. Sooner or later, you find your favorites and then you save that copy of your
                    character. You know that whenever you want to come back to this mall, you have this identity that you can go back to. You can change
                    it any time you want. Your character can go from Garage, Nike, and Elf to Sephora then become Hot Topic, Superdry, Chick-fil-a, and
                    Gongcha. These are all the characters you made and the mall stores them for you. These stores will almost always be there for you
                    when you want to come back, so long as they don’t change. The people of Queens gather and pick these different stores like how we
                    pick the morals and values in life that we resonate with. These stores that we pick to shop at are special to us because we choose
                    where we’ll shop when we go to the mall. The mall saves our path in there, it’s Queens’ storage drive for the different personalities
                    of Queens.</p>
                <p class="indent newroman">I find myself feeling like I’ve been betraying this part of Queens. I’ve lost
                    touch with this identity and I have taken other ways of shopping. I’ve been using online shopping more
                    recently than going to the mall and I haven’t been there in a while. But, I know the next time that I’ll
                    ever need to get that salicylic acid cleanser or sunscreen, I know where to go: The Queens Center Mall,
                    the center of the personalities of Queens.
